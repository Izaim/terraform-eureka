# Terraform Eureka Series

I named these series "Eureka" because the purpose is to give you a sense of how easy and effortless is to create infrastructure in AWS using Terraform, as a beginner. In additional to deploying these, I suggest you try to understand the code and modify it based on your requirements of your deployment. If you're here to learn, you'll have many "aha!" moments along the way. I wish you a good journey.

Anyway, here you'll find a series of Terraform templates built for various AWS architectures.

Templates will be continuously updated and new ones will be added to the series.

### Series

| SERIE | DIR |
| ------ | ------ |
| S3 Static Website with CloudFront and TLS | [[terraform-eureka/static-site](https://github.com/izaimo/terraform-eureka/tree/main/static-site)] |
| Stay Tuned! | [[terraform-eureka/x](https://github.com/izaimo/terraform-eureka/tree/main/x)] |

To deploy these Terraform architectures, you'll need Git, AWS CLI and Terraform installed on your system, here's how you install those:

- [How to install Git?](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
- [How to install and configure AWS CLI?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html)
- [How to install Terraform CLI?](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)

I assume many of you have these installed since you are here, but follow the upper links if you don't for a reason.

**Navigate through series for template specific READMEs.** That's it, I hope you enjoy it. Feel free to open any issues if you go through one.
